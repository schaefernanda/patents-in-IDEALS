The first signal is coupled to the PTF and the output of the PTF produces the second signal. A summer compares the output of the PTF and the desired signal to produce an error signal. A programmable delay line has time delays programmable to integer multiples of the PTF tap spacing to provide a delayed version of the first signal, and a multiplier multiplies the error signal and the delayed input of the programmable delay line to produce a gradient signal. The gradient signal is filtered with an analog lowpass filter to produce a filtered gradient signal which in turn is converted to a digital signal by a low bandwidth analog to digital converter. A microprocessor implements a filtered gradient algorithm to update the PTF filter tap, load the new tap weight into the PTF, and reconfigure the programmable delay line to produce a filtered gradient for another tap. The comparison of the PTF output with the desired signal continues to develop an error signal and the adaptive process is repeated until the error signal becomes substantially zero which results in the second signal more closely approximating the desired signal.",5272663

5801519.pdf,Self-excited power minimizer/maximizer for switching power converters and switching motor drive applications,"['Turnbull, Robert J.', 'Krein, Philip T.', 'Midya, Pallab']",1998-09-01,"In any steady-state optimization problem, the output being optimized could be a nonmonotonic function of the controlled variable. Often the output is dependent on the temperature, the load impedance, and other unknown and variable quantities. Thus, it is very useful to have an automatic tuning scheme that will take the system to the desired operating point using only input and output information. The present invention is a generalized tuning scheme that uses the correlation between changes in the input and corresponding changes in the output to tune the operating point. In general terms, the present invention utilizes a correlation function between the controlled variable and a perturbed waveform. When the system reaches the desired operating point, the correlation goes to zero and the system converges. This corresponds to the point at which the derivative of the output with respect to the input is zero. This tuning scheme is appropriate for any tuning problem which has a single maximum or minimum. A variety of tuning problems in power electronics and other areas fall into this category. A tuning scheme based on correlation usually requires an excitation input. The switching action in the controlled circuit perturbs all the states and provides this excitation. Thus, this tuning scheme is appropriate for switching power applications. A preferred embodiment of the present application is used to control a power converter in a solar array application.",5801519

A pump laser modulated at a first frequency is focused onto a diffraction limited spot to excite a fluorescent sample under study. Simultaneously, a probe laser modulated at a second frequency is focused onto the same spot to induce a stimulated fluorescence emission in response to the optically combined output of the pump and probe laser light. Fluorescence emitted from the sample produces a cross-correlation signal which is dependent upon the spatial overlapping of the pump and probe beams at the focal point thereby producing a beneficial axial sectioning effect. Choosing a small differency frequency between the modulation of the first and second laser sources produces a low frequency cross correlation signal even when the modulation frequencies of the pump and probe lasers are very high. A signal processor obtains modulation and phase information from the low frequency cross correlation fluorescence signal allowing monitoring of even ultrafast fluorescence phenomena induced by high frequency modulation of the pump and probe lasers.",5814820

An unsteady hinge moment is calculated which is dependent on the control surface steady hinge moment coefficient. By using a value which is relatively constant during uncontaminated surface conditions, this value can be compared against calculated values to check for variations. If the calculated unsteady value varies from the known uncontaminated values, a warning may be given, alerting an operator of unsafe conditions.

The resulting differential MMSE criterion leads to a number of novel algorithms for adaptive implementation of the MMSE receiver. Applications include equalization for single user systems, and multiuser detection, or interference suppression, for direct sequence CDMA with short spreading sequences (i.e., the period of the spreading sequence equals the symbol interval). The invention also provides blind (i.e., without the requirement of a training symbol sequence for the user of interest) equalization and beamforming (using a receive antenna array) for direct sequence CDMA systems with long spreading sequences (i.e., systems in which the spreading sequences are aperiodic, or have period much larger than the symbol interval). The invention enables recovery of the desired symbol sequence up to an unknown phase. The invention is therefore well suited to the demodulation of differentially modulated data, in which information is encoded in the phase differences of successive transmitted symbols. Assuming that the channel amplitude and phase is approximately constant over two successive symbol intervals, the demodulator can use the differences in phases of two successive received symbols to recover differentially encoded data. The invention may also be used in conjunction with a separate phase recovery method to demodulate data without differential modulation.",6426973

Errors inherent in wireless communication and unaccounted for in fair scheduling for wired networks are accounted for according to the method. Lagging communication flows, typically caused by burst errors in wireless communication systems, make up for their lag by causing leading flows to give up their lead. The method is independent of the pattern of channel error. In a preferred embodiment, lag compensation is accounted for by a service tag which identifies a precedence for contention based upon the previous denial of access for channel error. This precedence allows compensation when channels become error free. A modified preferred embodiment first attempts intraframe compensation by swapping slots when a host predicts an error for its assigned slot and another host assigned a later slot is able to transmit in the slot. Interframe compensation, when needed, is accomplished preferably by a round robin contention among backlogged flows. Errors are predicted by hosts for a subsequent slot when activity is sensed in a current slot but no good packet is received. Preferred packet structures include data and control slots, with data slots partitioned to provide necessary error status and backlog information piggybacked with data so a base has sufficient information to implement compensation in contention resolution.",6728257

The nanoparticles produced by the method of the invention are highly uniform in size. A very small percentage of significantly larger particles are produced, and such larger particles are easily filtered out. The method for producing the silicon nanoparticles of the invention utilizes a gradual advancing electrochemical etch of bulk silicon, e.g., a silicon wafer. The etch is conducted with use of an appropriate intermediate or low etch current density. An optimal current density for producing the family is &#732;10 milli Ampere per square centimeter (10 mA/cm2). Higher current density favors 1 nm particles, and lower the larger particles. Blue (1 nm) particles, if any appreciable quantity exist depending on the selected current density, may be removed by, for example, shaking or ultrasound. After the etch, the pulverized wafer is immersed in dilute HF for a short time, while the particles are still connected to the wafer to weaken the linkages between the larger particles. This may be followed by separation of nanoparticles from the surface of the silicon. Once separated, various methods may be employed to form plural nanoparticles into crystals, films and other desirable forms. The nanoparticles may also be coated or doped.

A unique feature of the present invention is its ability to account for aliasing effects and minimize the associated image distortion by optimally adapting the said MIMO interpolation (image reconstruction) kernels.

Our findings challenge the time-consuming nature of apoptosis. We describe herein the discovery and characterization of a small molecule, named Raptinal, which initiates intrinsic pathway caspase-dependent apoptosis within minutes, in multiple different cell lines. Comparison to a mechanistically diverse panel of apoptotic stimuli reveals Raptinal-induced apoptosis proceeds with unparalleled speed. The rapid phenotype enabled identification of the critical roles of mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel function, mitochondrial membrane potential/coupled respiration, and mitochondrial complex I, III and IV function for apoptosis induction. Use of Raptinal in whole organisms demonstrates its utility to study apoptosis in vivo for a variety of applications. Overall, rapid inducers of apoptosis are powerful tools that will be used in a variety of settings to generate further insight into the apoptotic machinery.",9682060
