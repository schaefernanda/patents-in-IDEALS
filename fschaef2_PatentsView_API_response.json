Often the output is dependent on the temperature, the load impedance, and other unknown and variable quantities. Thus, it is very useful to have an automatic tuning scheme that will take the system to the desired operating point using only input and output information. The present invention is a generalized tuning scheme that uses the correlation between changes in the input and corresponding changes in the output to tune the operating point. In general terms, the present invention utilizes a correlation function between the controlled variable and a perturbed waveform. When the system reaches the desired operating point, the correlation goes to zero and the system converges. This corresponds to the point at which the derivative of the output with respect to the input is zero. This tuning scheme is appropriate for any tuning problem which has a single maximum or minimum. A variety of tuning problems in power electronics and other areas fall into this category. A tuning scheme based on correlation usually requires an excitation input. The switching action in the controlled circuit perturbs all the states and provides this excitation. Thus, this tuning scheme is appropriate for switching power applications. A preferred embodiment of the present application is used to control a power converter in a solar array application.","inventors":[{"inventor_first_name":"Robert J.","inventor_last_name":"Turnbull","inventor_id":"3985841-1","inventor_key_id":"249390"},{"inventor_first_name":"Philip T.","inventor_last_name":"Krein","inventor_id":"5668464-1","inventor_key_id":"1391173"},{"inventor_first_name":"Pallab","inventor_last_name":"Midya","inventor_id":"5668464-2","inventor_key_id":"1391174"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_id":"org_VlpFCAQtEUuW0lcpQP8r","assignee_organization":"The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois","assignee_key_id":"371985"}],"applications":[{"app_number":"08668124","app_date":"1996-06-21","app_id":"08\/668124"}]},{"patent_number":"5804575","patent_type":"utility","patent_title":"Methods of manufacturing betulinic acid","patent_date":"1998-09-08","patent_abstract":"Improved methods of manufacturing betulinic acid from betulin are disclosed.

The resulting differential MMSE criterion leads to a number of novel algorithms for adaptive implementation of the MMSE receiver. Applications include equalization for single user systems, and multiuser detection, or interference suppression, for direct sequence CDMA with short spreading sequences (i.e., the period of the spreading sequence equals the symbol interval). The invention also provides blind (i.e., without the requirement of a training symbol sequence for the user of interest) equalization and beamforming (using a receive antenna array) for direct sequence CDMA systems with long spreading sequences (i.e., systems in which the spreading sequences are aperiodic, or have period much larger than the symbol interval). The invention enables recovery of the desired symbol sequence up to an unknown phase. The invention is therefore well suited to the demodulation of differentially modulated data, in which information is encoded in the phase differences of successive transmitted symbols. Assuming that the channel amplitude and phase is approximately constant over two successive symbol intervals, the demodulator can use the differences in phases of two successive received symbols to recover differentially encoded data. The invention may also be used in conjunction with a separate phase recovery method to demodulate data without differential modulation.","inventors":[{"inventor_first_name":"Upamanyu","inventor_last_name":"Madhow","inventor_id":"5343496-2","inventor_key_id":"1183238"},{"inventor_first_name":"Liping Julia","inventor_last_name":"Zhu","inventor_id":"6426973-2","inventor_key_id":"1836097"},{"inventor_first_name":"Luis","inventor_last_name":"Galup","inventor_id":"6426973-3","inventor_key_id":"1836098"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_id":"org_VlpFCAQtEUuW0lcpQP8r","assignee_organization":"The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois","assignee_key_id":"371985"}],"applications":[{"app_number":"09301912","app_date":"1999-04-29","app_id":"09\/301912"}]},{"patent_number":"6433146","patent_type":"utility","patent_title":"Corn oil and protein extraction method","patent_date":"2002-08-13","patent_abstract":"The invention is a corn product removal process that successfully extracts oil and zein from dry-milled corn.

Lagging communication flows, typically caused by burst errors in wireless communication systems, make up for their lag by causing leading flows to give up their lead. The method is independent of the pattern of channel error. In a preferred embodiment, lag compensation is accounted for by a service tag which identifies a precedence for contention based upon the previous denial of access for channel error. This precedence allows compensation when channels become error free. A modified preferred embodiment first attempts intraframe compensation by swapping slots when a host predicts an error for its assigned slot and another host assigned a later slot is able to transmit in the slot. Interframe compensation, when needed, is accomplished preferably by a round robin contention among backlogged flows. Errors are predicted by hosts for a subsequent slot when activity is sensed in a current slot but no good packet is received. Preferred packet structures include data and control slots, with data slots partitioned to provide necessary error status and backlog information piggybacked with data so a base has sufficient information to implement compensation in contention resolution.","inventors":[{"inventor_first_name":"Rayadurgam","inventor_last_name":"Srikant","inventor_id":"5805681-1","inventor_key_id":"1476454"},{"inventor_first_name":"Vaduvur","inventor_last_name":"Bharghavan","inventor_id":"6728257-1","inventor_key_id":"2002797"},{"inventor_first_name":"Songwu","inventor_last_name":"Lu","inventor_id":"6728257-2","inventor_key_id":"2002798"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_id":"org_VlpFCAQtEUuW0lcpQP8r","assignee_organization":"The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois","assignee_key_id":"371985"}],"applications":[{"app_number":"09143302","app_date":"1998-08-28","app_id":"09\/143302"}]},{"patent_number":"6728290","patent_type":"utility","patent_title":"Current biased dual DBR grating semiconductor laser","patent_date":"2004-04-27","patent_abstract":"A laser heterostructure having an active layer, a lateral waveguide terminating in an output aperture, and a gain section with a current drive electrode.

The nanoparticles produced by the method of the invention are highly uniform in size. A very small percentage of significantly larger particles are produced, and such larger particles are easily filtered out. The method for producing the silicon nanoparticles of the invention utilizes a gradual advancing electrochemical etch of bulk silicon, e.g., a silicon wafer. The etch is conducted with use of an appropriate intermediate or low etch current density. An optimal current density for producing the family is &#732;10 milli Ampere per square centimeter (10 mA\/cm2). Higher current density favors 1 nm particles, and lower the larger particles. Blue (1 nm) particles, if any appreciable quantity exist depending on the selected current density, may be removed by, for example, shaking or ultrasound. After the etch, the pulverized wafer is immersed in dilute HF for a short time, while the particles are still connected to the wafer to weaken the linkages between the larger particles. This may be followed by separation of nanoparticles from the surface of the silicon. Once separated, various methods may be employed to form plural nanoparticles into crystals, films and other desirable forms. The nanoparticles may also be coated or doped.

The nanoparticles produced by the method of the invention are highly uniform in size. A very small percentage of significantly larger particles are produced, and such larger particles are easily filtered out. The method for producing the silicon nanoparticles of the invention utilizes a gradual advancing electrochemical etch of bulk silicon, e.g., a silicon wafer. The etch is conducted with use of an appropriate intermediate or low etch current density. An optimal current density for producing the family is \u02dc10 milli Ampere per square centimeter (10 mA\/cm2). Higher current density favors 1 nm particles, and lower the larger particles. Blue (1 nm) particles, if any appreciable quantity exist depending on the selected current density, may be removed by, for example, shaking or ultrasound. After the etch, the pulverized wafer is immersed in dilute HF for a short time, while the particles are still connected to the wafer to weaken the linkages between the larger particles. This may be followed by separation of nanoparticles from the surface of the silicon. Once separated, various methods may be employed to form plural nanoparticles into crystals, films and other desirable forms. The nanoparticles may also be coated or doped. The invention produces the family of a discrete set of sized particles and not a continuous size distribution.

The substrate analogs are based on peptide sequences, shown to be related to the natural peptide substrates for memapsin 2. The substrate analogs contain at least one analog of an amide bond which is not capable of being cleaved by memapsin 2. Processes for the synthesis of two substrate analogues including isosteres at the sites of the critical amino acid residues were developed and the substrate analogues, OMR99-1 and OM99-2, were synthesized. OM99-2 is based on an octapeptide Glu-Val-Asn-Leu-Ala-Ala-Glu-Phe (SEQ ID NO:28) with the Leu-Ala peptide bond substituted by a transition-state isostere hydroxyethylene group (FIG. 1). The inhibition constant of OM99-2 is 1.6\u00d710\u22129 M against recombinant pro-memapsin 2.

This polymorphism is more prevalent in the African American population. The determination of an individual's genotype may be used as an indicator of the need for dietary selenium supplementation to inhibit tumor development. Compositions including the isolated protein, specific binding agents that recognize the protein, as well as underlying nucleic acid sequences are presented, as are methods of using such compositions.","inventors":[{"inventor_first_name":"Vadim N.","inventor_last_name":"Gladyshev","inventor_id":"6849417-1","inventor_key_id":"2068600"},{"inventor_first_name":"Dolph L.","inventor_last_name":"Hatfield","inventor_id":"6849417-2","inventor_key_id":"2068601"},{"inventor_first_name":"Kuan-Teh","inventor_last_name":"Jeang","inventor_id":"6849417-3","inventor_key_id":"2068602"},{"inventor_first_name":"Alan","inventor_last_name":"Diamond","inventor_id":"6849417-4","inventor_key_id":"2068603"},{"inventor_first_name":"John C.","inventor_last_name":"Wootton","inventor_id":"6849417-5","inventor_key_id":"2068604"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_id":"org_saQhRz2IGa0Jn68tq6M3","assignee_organization":"The United States of America as represented by the Department of Health and Human Services","assignee_key_id":"325459"},{"assignee_id":"org_VlpFCAQtEUuW0lcpQP8r","assignee_organization":"The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois","assignee_key_id":"371985"}],"applications":[{"app_number":"12234968","app_date":"2008-09-22","app_id":"12\/234968"}]},{"patent_number":"7776819","patent_type":"utility","patent_title":"Targeted drug delivery of pain and addiction therapies using opioid receptor-mediated internalization","patent_date":"2010-08-17","patent_abstract":"Drug delivery is targeted to new opioid receptors using receptor-mediated internalization. Dermorphin was successfully conjugated to DSPE-PEG3400 without affecting the affinity to its receptor. The synthesized conjugate was inserted into preformed sterically stabilized liposomes to obtain dermorphin-grafted SSL. DSPE-PEG34Qo-dermorphin and dermorphin-SSL retained their affinity and selectivity for MOR. Moreover, dermorphin-SSL and encapsulated probes were taken up by CHO-hMOR cells, but not by naive CHO cells or very closely related CHO-hDOR cells. Dermorphin-SSL can be used to deliver drugs to the intracellular component of intended cells with high fidelity. Therefore, dermorphin-SSL is useful to carry pharmaceutical agents to achieve region-specific delivery of analgesics and\/or to attenuate side effects associated with opioids.","inventors":[{"inventor_first_name":"Zaijie Jim","inventor_last_name":"Wang","inventor_id":"7776819-1","inventor_key_id":"2537256"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_id":"org_VlpFCAQtEUuW0lcpQP8r","assignee_organization":"The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois","assignee_key_id":"371985"}],"applications":[{"app_number":"11817431","app_date":"2006-03-02","app_id":"11\/817431"}]},{"patent_number":"7785728","patent_type":"utility","patent_title":"Palladium-based electrocatalysts and fuel cells employing such electrocatalysts","patent_date":"2010-08-31","patent_abstract":"A direct organic fuel cell includes a fluid fuel comprising formic acid, an anode having an electrocatalyst comprising palladium nanoparticles, a fluid oxidant, a cathode electrically connected to the anode, and an electrolyte interposed between the anode and the cathode.","inventors":[{"inventor_first_name":"Robert Thomas","inventor_last_name":"Larsen","inventor_id":"5356810-3","inventor_key_id":"1191991"},{"inventor_first_name":"Richard I.","inventor_last_name":"Masel","inventor_id":"5674067-1","inventor_key_id":"1394693"},{"inventor_first_name":"Yimin","inventor_last_name":"Zhu","inventor_id":"7014931-1","inventor_key_id":"2155610"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_id":"org_VlpFCAQtEUuW0lcpQP8r","assignee_organization":"The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois","assignee_key_id":"371985"}],"applications":[{"app_number":"10817361","app_date":"2004-04-02","app_id":"10\/817361"}]},{"patent_number":"7785825","patent_type":"utility","patent_title":"Compositions and methods for dehydration and cyclization of peptides, synthetic compounds, and lantibiotics","patent_date":"2010-08-31","patent_abstract":"Lantibiotics are synthesized on ribosomes as prepeptides and post-translationally modified to a mature form.

The substrate analogs are based on peptide sequences, shown to be related to the natural peptide substrates for memapsin 2. The substrate analogs contain at least one analog of an amide bond which is not capable of being cleaved by memapsin 2. Processes for the synthesis of two substrate analogues including isosteres at the sites of the critical amino acid residues were developed and the substrate analogues, OMR99-1 and OM99-2, were synthesized. OM99-2 is based on an octapeptide Glu-Val-Asn-Leu-Ala-Ala-Glu-Phe (SEQ ID NO:28) with the Leu-Ala peptide bond substituted by a transition-state isostere hydroxyethylene group (FIG. 1). The inhibition constant of OM99-2 is 1.6\u00d710\u22129 M against recombinant pro-memapsin 2.

A unique feature of the present invention is its ability to account for aliasing effects and minimize the associated image distortion by optimally adapting the said MIMO interpolation (image reconstruction) kernels.

The high concentration attainable (>2.0 M) for RAPs in common non-aqueous battery solvents, their electrochemical and chemical reversibility, and their hindered transport across porous separators make them attractive materials for non-aqueous redox flow batteries based on size-selectivity.","inventors":[{"inventor_first_name":"Jeffrey S.","inventor_last_name":"Moore","inventor_id":"5334752-2","inventor_key_id":"1177694"},{"inventor_first_name":"Nagarjuna","inventor_last_name":"Gavvalapalli","inventor_id":"9982068-1","inventor_key_id":"3549598"},{"inventor_first_name":"Joaquin","inventor_last_name":"Rodriguez-Lopez","inventor_id":"9982068-3","inventor_key_id":"3549599"},{"inventor_first_name":"Kevin","inventor_last_name":"Cheng","inventor_id":"9982068-4","inventor_key_id":"3549600"},{"inventor_first_name":"Mei","inventor_last_name":"Shen","inventor_id":"9982068-5","inventor_key_id":"3549601"},{"inventor_first_name":"Timothy","inventor_last_name":"Lichtenstein","inventor_id":"9982068-6","inventor_key_id":"3549602"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_id":"org_VlpFCAQtEUuW0lcpQP8r","assignee_organization":"The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois","assignee_key_id":"371985"}],"applications":[{"app_number":"15000910","app_date":"2016-01-19","app_id":"15\/000910"}]},{"patent_number":"9983206","patent_type":"utility","patent_title":"Methods and compositions for enhancing immunoassays","patent_date":"2018-05-29","patent_abstract":"Embodiments of the methods, compositions, and systems provided herein relate to enzymatic enhancement of immunoassays using photonic sensor arrays.","inventors":[{"inventor_first_name":"Ryan C.","inventor_last_name":"Bailey","inventor_id":"8354231-2","inventor_key_id":"2810000"},{"inventor_first_name":"Abraham J.","inventor_last_name":"Qavi","inventor_id":"9921165-2","inventor_key_id":"3522575"},{"inventor_first_name":"Jared T.","inventor_last_name":"Kindt","inventor_id":"9921165-3","inventor_key_id":"3522576"},{"inventor_first_name":"Matthew S.","inventor_last_name":"Luchansky","inventor_id":"9921165-5","inventor_key_id":"3522578"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_id":"org_VlpFCAQtEUuW0lcpQP8r","assignee_organization":"The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois","assignee_key_id":"371985"}],"applications":[{"app_number":"14209746","app_date":"2014-03-13","app_id":"14\/209746"}]},{"patent_number":"9986924","patent_type":"utility","patent_title":"Implantable biomedical devices on bioresorbable substrates","patent_date":"2018-06-05","patent_abstract":"Provided herein are implantable biomedical devices and methods of administering implantable biomedical devices, making implantable biomedical devices, and using implantable biomedical devices to actuate a target tissue or sense a parameter associated with the target tissue in a biological environment.","inventors":[{"inventor_first_name":"David L.","inventor_last_name":"Kaplan","inventor_id":"5015293-2","inventor_key_id":"971226"},{"inventor_first_name":"John A.","inventor_last_name":"Rogers","inventor_id":"5251286-3","inventor_key_id":"1123894"},{"inventor_first_name":"Brian","inventor_last_name":"Litt","inventor_id":"6594524-3","inventor_key_id":"1928747"},{"inventor_first_name":"Yonggang","inventor_last_name":"Huang","inventor_id":"7363173-2","inventor_key_id":"2333244"},{"inventor_first_name":"Dae Hyeong","inventor_last_name":"Kim","inventor_id":"7364600-1","inventor_key_id":"2333976"},{"inventor_first_name":"Fiorenzo G.","inventor_last_name":"Omenetto","inventor_id":"8195021-2","inventor_key_id":"2734582"},{"inventor_first_name":"Jonathan","inventor_last_name":"Viventi","inventor_id":"8666471-6","inventor_key_id":"2957092"},{"inventor_first_name":"Jason J.","inventor_last_name":"Amsden","inventor_id":"8666471-8","inventor_key_id":"2957093"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_id":"org_i0wuqfUboNGy6PnlNAf4","assignee_organization":"Northwestern University","assignee_key_id":"185223"},{"assignee_id":"org_M2myUGCkgH2yb5FJVpGz","assignee_organization":"Trustees of Tufts College","assignee_key_id":"240624"},{"assignee_id":"org_VlpFCAQtEUuW0lcpQP8r","assignee_organization":"The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois","assignee_key_id":"371985"},{"assignee_id":"org_XPIyaEY1w74yDspodF6F","assignee_organization":"The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania","assignee_key_id":"400890"}],"applications":[{"app_number":"14140299","app_date":"2013-12-24","app_id":"14\/140299"}]},{"patent_number":"9988746","patent_type":"utility","patent_title":"Partially degradable fibers and microvascular materials formed from the fibers","patent_date":"2018-06-05","patent_abstract":"A partially degradable polymeric fiber includes a thermally degradable polymeric core and a coating surrounding at least a portion of the core.
