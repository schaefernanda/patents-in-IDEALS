# patents-in-IDEALS
A repository for my final project for the IS 452: Foundations of Information Processing class at the iSchool at Illinois. In this project, I explored a way to get metadata and files for patents granted to the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois into the IDEALS institutional repository. Being that IDEALS hosts scholarly work only from the Urbana-Champaign campus, a significant portion of this project involved narrowing down the patents to only those issued to inventors affiliated with the Urbana-Champaign campus. For this purpose, inventor data from the Office of Technology Management was obtained.
